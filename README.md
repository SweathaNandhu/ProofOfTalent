# 🌟 Proof of Talent — Showcase Your Skills on the Blockchain



---

💭 **What is Proof of Talent?**

Proof of Talent is a **web-based dApp** that lets individuals **mint NFTs as proof of their skills** on the **Andromeda blockchain**.  
Every NFT represents a **verifiable skill credential**, giving people a way to prove their talent transparently, securely, and without bias.  

With Proof of Talent, users can:

- 🎨 **Mint skill NFTs** tied to their expertise  
- 🔍 **Explore** all minted skills across the platform  
- 👤 **View profiles** of creators and contributors  
- 👍 **Endorse others** with reputation tokens (CW20)  

It’s your **on-chain resume** — tamper-proof, verifiable, and community-driven.

💡 **Why We Built This**

Traditional resumes are **self-reported, unverifiable, and biased**. Platforms like LinkedIn suffer from skill inflation and fake achievements.  
DAOs and decentralized communities also struggle with **trust & reputation** when onboarding contributors.  

We built Proof of Talent to:  

- ✅ Create **trustless, transparent skill verification**  
- ✅ Give individuals **ownership of their credentials**  
- ✅ Enable **community validation** through endorsements  
- ✅ Showcase **verifiable proof of talent** for hiring & collaborations

🧠 **Architecture Overview**

Proof of Talent combines **Next.js** frontend with **Andromeda ADO components**:  

- **CW721 (NFTs):** Each skill is minted as an NFT with metadata (skill name, level, proof link).  
- **CW20 (Reputation):** Optional tokens to represent endorsements ("likes").  
- **Queries:** Fetch all NFTs via `all_tokens` and display across the app.  
- **Permissions:** Ensure only rightful users can mint/update their skills.
